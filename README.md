# Langchain-introduction
LangChain is a powerful framework designed to build applications around large language models (LLMs). It helps in creating robust, scalable, and production-ready applications by combining multiple components like language models, data sources, APIs, and various computation resources into a cohesive workflow.

## Key Features

- **Chain Management**: LangChain allows you to combine multiple LLM calls into chains, providing structure and control over model outputs.
- **Integration with External Data**: Easily access external data sources (e.g., databases, APIs) and use them with LLMs to make the models more informed and context-aware.
- **Agent Framework**: The agent framework allows LLMs to perform tasks, make decisions, and dynamically adjust workflows based on real-time input.
- **Memory**: LangChain provides mechanisms for storing and managing intermediate model responses, improving interaction and enhancing user experiences.
- **Custom Tooling**: You can extend the platform with custom tools and APIs to adapt LangChain for specific applications.
  
## Installation

To install LangChain, run:

```bash
pip install langchain
```

## Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of chaining together LLM responses:

```python
from langchain import OpenAI, LLMChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

# Define a prompt template
prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["topic"], template="Tell me about {topic}.")

# Set up the LLM chain
llm = OpenAI(api_key="your-openai-key")
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)

# Run the chain
output = chain.run("quantum physics")
print(output)
```
